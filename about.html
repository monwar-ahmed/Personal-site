  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey! I’m Monwar Ahmed Minar. I am a curious and creative individual with a passion for learning, building, and sharing ideas. I'm currently exploring the world of web development and content creation, and I enjoy turning simple ideas into something useful and meaningful online.</p>
  
  <h1>Background & Education</h1>
  <p>
    I was born on October 11, 2004, and I come from Sylhet, Bangladesh. I have always had a love for technology. I completed my 10th (SSC) and 12th (HSC) from Jalalabad Cantonment English School & College. Currently, I am pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering at Metropolitan University. <br><br>
    I believe education doesn’t end in the classroom—it’s something I continue every day by building projects and gaining real-world experience.
  </p>

  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <p>So far, I’ve learned the basics of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Structure & Algorithm</li>
    <li>Python Basics</li>
    <li>C, C++</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I’ve also built a few small projects like to-do list apps, portfolio pages, landing pages, and mini blogs. Each project helps me grow and gives me the confidence to take on new challenges.</p>

  <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
  <p>Outside of tech, I’m someone who enjoys:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Content Creation:</b> Sharing ideas through videos, stories, or blogs</li>
    <li><b>Gaming:</b> A fun way to relax and sometimes learn too</li>
    <li><b>Playing:</b> Cricket, football, carrom, badminton—these games refresh me and bring joy</li>
    <li><b>Traveling:</b> I love discovering new places—it refreshes my mind and sparks creativity. Exploring different cultures helps me see the world from new perspectives.</li>
    <li><b>Eating:</b> I'm a big fan of delicious food—trying new flavors is one of my favorite ways to enjoy life. Whether it's street snacks or homemade meals, good food always makes me happy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Goals & Vision</h1>
  <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning full-stack development and building a strong online presence through my projects and content. My long-term goal is to create value for people—whether it’s through useful websites, informative content, or creative collaborations. <br><br>
  If you’re someone who’s passionate about tech, learning, or building cool things, I’d love to connect! Thanks for taking the time to learn about me.</p>
